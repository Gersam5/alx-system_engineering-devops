### Incident Report (Postmortem)

#### Issue Summary
On October 21, 2023, at 8:03 AM EAT, I received a dependency alert from GitHub regarding a forked repository, Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge. This alert was sent every 7 days, indicating a recurring dependency issue. The root cause of these alerts was the presence of outdated software versions in the repository.

#### Timeline

- **October 21, 2023, 8:03 AM EAT**: Initial dependency alert received from GitHub.
- **Every 7 days after initial alert**: Recurring dependency alerts received from GitHub.
- **Current status**: Issue remains unresolved as it was deemed non-critical and debugging efforts were deprioritized.

#### Root Cause Analysis
The primary cause of the issue was the outdated versions of several dependencies in the forked repository. Specifically:

1. **Security Updates**:
   - Vendored libxml2 updated to address CVE-2022-2309, CVE-2022-40304, and CVE-2022-40303. More information can be found in GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw.
   - Vendored zlib updated to address CVE-2022-37434. Although Nokogiri was not affected by this vulnerability, this version of zlib was flagged by vulnerability scanners. See issue #2626 for more information.

2. **Dependencies Updates**:
   - Vendored libxml2 updated to v2.10.3 from v2.9.14.
   - Vendored libxslt updated to v1.1.37 from v1.1.35.
   - Vendored zlib updated from 1.2.12 to 1.2.13. Details on package redistribution can be found in LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md.

3. **Fixed Issues**:
   - Nokogiri::XML::Namespace objects, when compacted, now correctly update their internal struct's reference to the Ruby object wrapper, preventing segmentation faults after GC compaction. Refer to issue #2658 for details.
   - Document#remove_namespaces! now defers freeing the underlying xmlNs struct until the Document is garbage collected, preventing potential segmentation faults. Refer to issue #2658 for details.

#### Resolution and Recovery
The resolution to this issue involves updating the outdated dependencies as per the alerts. Specifically, updating the versions of libxml2, libxslt, and zlib to their latest secure versions.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. **Automated Dependency Updates**: Ensure GitHub alerts for dependencies are enabled and acted upon promptly.
2. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule regular maintenance checks to update dependencies and address potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement a monitoring system to detect and alert on outdated or vulnerable dependencies, ensuring timely updates.

By implementing these measures, we can ensure the repository remains secure and up-to-date with the latest dependency versions.
